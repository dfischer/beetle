Add default lengths to DISASSEMBLE (64) and DUMP (256)

Completion of filenames containing - (currently does “-BAD”)

Filenames containing ~ complete nicely but do not work: use wordexp(3).

Add instructions to completion (use --break-chars to rlwrap).

Reorganize C implementation documentation into user’s guide and programmer’s guide.

Run demo as test.

Turn tests into debugger scripts.

Auto-realloc stacks when they run out of space.

Compile at load time using ideas in DDJ article
