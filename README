This package comprises the definition of the Beetle virtual machine, a
virtual machine specialised for the execution of Forth, an
implementation in ISO C99 using POSIX APIs, and a full ANSI Forth
compiler, pForth. Detailed documentation is in the doc directory;
installation instructions follow.

The package is distributed under the GNU Public License version 3, or,
at your option, any later version.

THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH NO WARRANTY. USE IS AT THE USER'S
RISK.


Installation and compatibility
------------------------------

Beetle should work on any POSIX-1.2001-compatible system that uses
twos complement arithmetic.

Beetle has been tested on GNU/Linux with GNU C.

Previous releases were known to work on Acorn RISC OS 3, Digital UNIX
V3.2, UNIX System V Release 4.0, ULTRIX 4.3, NetBSD 1.2, MSDOS 6, and
Atari TOS 1.4.

Reports on compatibility, whether positive or negative, are welcomed.

To build Beetle from a release tarball, run

./configure && make && make check

If building from a Git repository, first run

./bootstrap


pForth
------

pForth is an ANSI Forth compiler. An executable is provided with
Beetle (the file pForthImage); the sources are available separately:

Hand-written ARM assembler version
----------------------------------

ARMbeetle.bas contains a hand-written ARM assembler version of Beetle,
written in the BBC BASIC assembler (for RISC OS). It produces AOF
format objects equivalent to those produced by run.c and step.c, which
can be linked in their place.


Bugs and comments
-----------------

Please send me bug reports and comments. I'm especially interested to
know of portability bugs.

The BA dissertation to which the documentation frequently refers is
available from the URL above, but all the relevant bits of it are
included as separate documents.
